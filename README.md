# kotlin-concurrency
This project is a collection of mini projects written in Kotlin,
which show how concurrent backend code can be written in Kotlin.

## Classic
Under `classic` you can find examples of Java's classical approaches and their gotchas.

## Reactive
`reactive` contains examples of using Spring's WebFlux and Akka actors for handling concurrency.

## Coroutines
The project `coroutines` shows Kotlin's own (and preferred) model of handling concurrency, 
which is based on the concept of suspending functions and `kotlinx.coroutines` library.
